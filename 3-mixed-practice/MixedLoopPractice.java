 * APCS-A - Mixed Loop Practice
 *
 * This program is to give you practice writing methods that use for loops. Your
 * task is to study the code and output for methods that I have completed. Then 
 * you should complete and test the methods that are incomplete or missing. 
 *
 *  1) oneToThirtyF    - uses a for loop to print the set {1, 2, 3, ... , 30}.
 *
 *  2) oneToThirtyW    - uses a while loop to print the set {1, 2, 3, ... , 30}.
 *
 *  3) twentyToZeroF   - uses a for loop to print the set {20, 18, 16, ... , 0}.
 *
 *  4) twentyToZeroW   - uses a while loop to print the set {20, 18, 16, ... , 0}.
 *
 *  6) countMtoN       - uses a while loop to print the set {m, m+1, m+2, ... , n}.
 *
 *  7) sumN            - uses a while loop to find and return the sum of the first 
 *                       n integers. 
 *                       
 *  8) perfectSquaresF - uses a for loop to print the first n perfect squares.
 *
 *  9) sumSquaresW     - uses a while loop find and return the sum of the first n 
 *                       perfect squares.
 *
 * 10) iLoveJava       - uses a while loop to print the sentence "I love java." n
 *                       times.
 *
 * 11) divBy2and9      - uses a for loop to count from 1 to 100 by ones, but only
 *                       values that are evenly divisible by 2 and 9 are printed.
 *                       (you'll need to use an if statement.)
 *
 * 12) divBy3and8      - uses a while loop to count from 1 to 100 by ones, but only
 *                       values that are evenly divisible by 3 and 8 are printed.
 *                       (you'll need to use an if statement.)
 *
 * 13) divBy5or7Sum    - uses a while loop to find and return the sum of all values in 
 *                       the set {1, 2, 3, ... , 10000} that are divisible by 5 or 7.
 *
 * 14) bizzBuzz        - uses a while loop to count from 1 to n by ones. However,
 *                       if a number is divisible by 3, the word "bizz" should be 
 *                       printed, and if the number is divisible by 5, "buzz" should
 *                       be printed. Sample output:
 *
 *                       1, 2, Bizz, 4, Buzz, Bizz, 7, 8, Bizz, Buzz, 11, Bizz, 13, 14, 
 *                       Bizz Buzz, 16, 17, Bizz, 19, Buzz, Bizz, 22, 23, Bizz, ...
 *                       
 * 15) sumDigits       - uses a loop to find and return the sum of the digits in an int.
 *
 * 16) countEvens      - uses a loop to count the number of even digits in an int.
 *
 * 17) hasDigit        - uses the appropriate type of loop to return true if a number n
 *                       contains the digit d and false otherwise.
 *
 * 18) moreEvens       - returns true if a number n has more even digits than odd digits
 *                       and false otherwise.
